- **ChatGPT:** Utilized for generating mock data for the Weather Impact Stats table, turning README into Markdown, and learning how to use current date JavaScript.

**Prompts Used for ChatGPT:**

Generate mock data for a table displaying the latest weather analysis and its impact on MLB player statistics. Include columns for date, location, temperature (in °F), wind speed (in mph), and impact on stats. The data should cover various cities and weather conditions.
Convert the README file of my project into Markdown format. Ensure that all headings, lists, links, and other formatting elements are correctly translated to Markdown syntax. Additionally, include any necessary code blocks or formatting for clarity and readability.
I want the date column in the chart to be updated daily with the current date. How could I do this with JavaScript?

## Reflection of Resources

ChatGPT was significant in helping generate mock data for my table. The data would have taken hours for me to fill in, and I was able to use this time on other important parts of the project. Regarding the current date JavaScript in the chart on the Weather Impact Stats page, I was unfamiliar with how to implement it until I used generative AI. A challenge that I faced with ChatGPT was writing effective prompts. If i didn't correctly convey exactly what I wanted, ChatGPT was not successful.
